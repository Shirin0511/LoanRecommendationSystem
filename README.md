## 💡 Project Overview

This project goes beyond simple loan grade prediction — it actively **recommends the best loan term** for a given customer profile by simulating multiple scenarios and identifying the option that minimises risk. Built on **100,000 real Lending Club loan records** (2007–2018).

### 🎯 The Core Question
> *Given a customer's financial profile and desired loan amount, what loan term gives them the best risk outcome?*

## 🔬 Approach

Three approaches were built and compared:

| Approach | Accuracy | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 📏 Rule-Based Baseline | 35% | Manual thresholds using FICO, DTI, loan amount |
| 🤖 XGBoost Classifier | **68%** | ML model with class weights and hyperparameter tuning |
| 🎯 Recommendation Engine | — | XGBoost + scenario search across loan parameters |

The XGBoost model achieves **68% accuracy** on 3-class risk prediction — nearly **double** the rule-based baseline — with no data leakage (interest rate excluded as it is assigned post-grade).

## 🚦 Risk Tiers

| Tier | Lending Club Grades | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Low Risk | A, B | Strong credit profile |
| 🟡 Medium Risk | C, D | Moderate credit profile |
| 🔴 High Risk | E, F, G | Weak credit profile |

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Logic

```
Step 1 — Try both terms (36 and 60 months) at requested loan amount
Step 2 — If neither gives Low Risk, search lower amounts in $2,500 steps
Step 3 — Recommend: lowest risk tier → shortest term → highest loan amount
Step 4 — If Low Risk never achievable, recommend best available option
```

## 📦 Dataset

**Source:** [Lending Club Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club) via Kaggle

- 📋 100,000 loan records sampled from 2.2M total records (2007–2018)
- 🔽 151 original features reduced to **12** after feature selection

**Key features used:**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `fico_avg` | Average FICO credit score |
| `loan_amnt` | Requested loan amount |
| `annual_inc` | Annual income |
| `dti` | Debt-to-income ratio |
| `emp_length` | Years of employment |
| `revol_util` | Credit utilisation rate |
| `revol_bal` | Revolving balance |
| `total_acc` | Total credit accounts |
| `home_ownership` | RENT / MORTGAGE / OWN |
| `purpose` | Loan purpose |
| `term` | 36 or 60 months |

> ⚠️ **Note:** `int_rate` (interest rate) was deliberately excluded to prevent data leakage — interest rate is assigned *after* grade determination, not before.

---

## 📊 EDA Highlights

- 📉 Grade distribution is imbalanced — B and C dominate (~60%), G is <1%
- 📈 FICO score shows **strong negative correlation** with risk tier
- 💰 Loan amounts are right-skewed with spikes at round numbers ($10k, $15k, $20k)
- 🔄 Debt consolidation accounts for ~55% of all loan purposes
- 🔗 `loan_amnt` and `installment` are highly correlated (0.94) — `installment` dropped
- 📌 DTI shows weak standalone relationship with grade but contributes in combination

## ⚙️ Model Details

**XGBoost Hyperparameters:**

```python
XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=8,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    min_child_weight=3,
    gamma=0.1
)
```

**Class Imbalance Handling:**

```python
sample_weights = compute_sample_weight(
    class_weight={0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 3},  # 3x weight for High Risk
    y=y_train
)
```

**📋 Classification Report:**

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
    Low Risk       0.76      0.79      0.77      9653
 Medium Risk       0.65      0.60      0.62      8508
   High Risk       0.43      0.50      0.46      1839
    accuracy                           0.68     20000
```

## 🔍 SHAP Explainability

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to validate that model decisions align with domain knowledge:

| Feature | Impact |
|---|---|
| `fico_avg` | ✅ High FICO pushes away from Medium/High Risk |
| `term_60` | ✅ 60-month term increases risk probability |
| `loan_amnt` | ✅ Higher loan amount increases risk |
| `dti` | ✅ Higher debt burden increases risk |

## 💎 Key Learnings

- 🛡️ **Data leakage prevention** — identifying and excluding post-loan features like `int_rate`
- ⚖️ **Class imbalance handling** — using sample weights to improve High Risk recall from 24% to 50%
- 🔨 **Feature engineering** — deriving `fico_avg` from range columns, rare label encoding for purpose
- 🔍 **Model explainability** — using SHAP to validate business logic behind predictions
- 🧩 **Recommendation system design** — converting a classifier into a scenario-based recommender
